## CompanyTab


CompanyTab makes it simple to spread information to your employees. It's a chrome extension and web app that shows company announcements, quick links and timezones. Once you've installed the chrome extension and logged in with your work gmail address, every new tab will show important company information.

#### Problem
As companies grow in size, it becomes increasingly difficult to spread information around. Announcments disappear in Slack feeds or in email inboxes. Employees get more disconnected. CompanyTab is a simple tool to take over your employees new tab page and highlight the latest company announcements.
